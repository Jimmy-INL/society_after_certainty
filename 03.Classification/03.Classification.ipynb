    "We use classification algorithms when we are trying to predict class assignment based on one or more input variables. Classification differs from regression in that we are trying to identify class assignment, not output values. As in all things in life, there's gray area, but you generally think of classification as what you can do when you have training data that has labeled categories, and you are trying to predict the categories of unlabeled data.

If we did our job perfectly, our model will assign accurate labels for every input data matrix we are given. But...we probably going to get some wrong, and our goal is to gauge how much wrong we are willing to tolerate.\n",
