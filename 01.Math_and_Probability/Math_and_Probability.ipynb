    "Well, a pillar of probability theory, the Central Limit Theorem, may shed some light. This states, \"given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined (finite) expected value and finite variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution\" [Wikipedia] \"As n gets larger, the distribution of the difference between the sample average Sn and its limit µ, when multiplied by the factor √n (that is √n(Sn − µ)), approximates the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ2\"\n",
