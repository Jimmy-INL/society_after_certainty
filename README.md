# society_after_certainty

This book delves into the math, code and intuition of some of the most beloved algorithms and heuristics in machine learning. 
I have done my best to assemble an inspiring bouquet, yet the arrangement is by no means exhaustive. The history of science is a burgeoning, fecund garden of discovery, and what I have assembled here is merely a collection of flowers that happened to be bloom in the age I found myself. 

I have done my best to fold in historical context and real-world applications, as well as moments of reflection from the humanities and knowledge traditions beyond my particular occidental heritage. I hope this helps to ventilate the narrative. I believe in building a society after certainty, which demands the steady erosion of the hegemony of any knowledge systems that foolishly positions itself as the greater explainer of all things. Such obnoxious postures of thought are not becoming to those championing new horizons of inference. 

This book is free. It is my offering to the community of researchers, mathematicians, and engineers whose collegial sparring have sharpened my mind, and whom inspire me to dive deeper into the depths of the unknown. If you have found this book valuable, please consider making a donation to a local organization serving and empowering those most in need, like Techtonica!
