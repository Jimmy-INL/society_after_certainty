# Machine Learning in Complex Systems

This free online book delves into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in machine learning and computational modeling. The scope is by no means exhaustive, yet represents a suite of tools that I hope will inspire your imagination. 

I have done my best to use humor and plain spoken language, because that's more fun. If you find value here, please consider supporting a local organization empowering the potential of others, such as [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/)
