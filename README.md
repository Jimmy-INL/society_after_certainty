# Society After Certainty

This is a machine learning primer delving into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics. The arrangement is by no means exhaustive, yet represents a suite of tools that can inspire the imaginatoin as to what is possible in machine learning.

I have done my best to use humor and plain spoken language, because that's more fun. Also, the data examples I use highlight the historical contributions of women in STEM, because women have built awesome things over the years that are worthy of our praise and gratitude.
