# Society After Certainty

This free online book delves into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in machine learning and predictive modeling. The scope is by no means exhaustive, yet represents a suite of tools I hope you will find inspiring. 

The title of the book refers to a vision I hold for the role machine learning can play in fostering new modes of dreaming, modeling, planning, and building. Our biological sensors have blind spots, as do our inherited systems of meaning-making, which means we must continue to labor towards more flexible forms of inference that situate us beyond the bias of certainty. It is my hope that you will join me in this pursuit, as we leverage ML to build tools, systems, practices, networks, and models that foster greater equity and compassion for life's prolific complexity. 

I have done my best to stitch in humor, and promise to use plain spoken language throughout. I don't think math equations have be scarry, and like to use them as visual aids to make sure we are both on the same page.
