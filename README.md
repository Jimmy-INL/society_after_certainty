# Society After Certainty

This free online book delves into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in machine learning and computational modeling. The scope is by no means exhaustive, yet represents a suite of tools I hope you will find inspiring. 

The title of the book refers to a vision I hold for the role machine learning can play in fostering new modes of ideation, planning, and being. I form conceptions of reality based on reason and data, catalyzed by non-dulaist traditions of compassion and kindness. As someone who is aware of the limitations of their biological sensors and inherited meaning-making systems, I place very little faith in certainty, and labor instead towards a society after certainty.  

I have done my best to use humor and plain spoken language throughout, because that's more fun. If you find value here, please consider supporting a local organization empowering the potential of others, such as [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/)
