# Society After Certainty

This book delves into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most beloved algorithms and heuristics in machine learning. I have assembled what I hope will be an inspiring bouquet, yet the arrangement is by no means exhaustive. In the burgeoning, fecund garden of science, we will stroll capriocously and admire the flowers that happen to be in bloom at this particular moment in history. 

I have done my best to fold in reflections from the humanities, as I believe there are many facets of our humanity that participate in our development as scientists. I have also included references to knowledge traditions beyond the occidental lineage, as I am committed to destabilizing the hegemony of western certainty. Such certainty does not serve us who champion new horizons of inference.
