# Society After Certainty

This free online book delves into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in machine learning and computational modeling. The scope is by no means exhaustive, yet represents a suite of tools I hope you will find inspiring. 

The title of the book refers to a vision I hold for the role machine learning can play in fostering new modes of dreaming, modeling, planning, and building. Our biological sensors have blind spots, as do our inherited systems of meaning-making, which means we must continue to labor towards more flexible forms of inference that situate us beyond the bias of certainty. It is my hope that you will join me in this pursuit, as we leverate ML to build tools, systems, practices, networks, and models that foster greater equity, compassion, and a more just society. 

I have done my best to use humor and plain spoken language throughout, and warmly welcome your constructive feedback.
