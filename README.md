# Society After Certainty

This book delves into the math, code and intuition behind some of the most beloved algorithms and heuristics in machine learning. I have assembled what I hope will be an inspiring bouquet, yet the arrangement is by no means exhaustive. In the burgeoning, fecund garden of science, we will stroll capriocously and admire the flowers that happen to be bloom at this moment in history. 

I have done my best to fold in a few moments of reflection from the humanities, since there are many facets of your humanity that can assist you in your development as a scientist. You'll also find references to knowledge traditions beyond the occidental lineage, as I am committed to destabilizing the hegemony of western certainty. Colonial lines of inquiry do not serve us who champion new horizons of inference.
