# Society After Certainty

This computational intelligence primer delves into the code and math behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in use today in the field of soft computing. This is a fascinating and sprawling field, so the terrain explored here is by no means exhaustive, yet I hope there is enough to inspire you to journey further.

The title refers to a vision I had which launched me into this line of research. A vision of the society that will flourish once we move beyond the toxic legacy of reductionist models of complex systems, and the role computational intelligence can play in catalyzing this rennaisance. 

As biological creatures, we have blind spots. Our individual practices of mind and models of reality don't always line up with reality itself. Rather than cast fantasies into the future, and forever beat our heads against the deltas that emerge between these fantasies and overserved reality,  computational intelligence posits real-time, bottom-up, biologically-inspired modeling heuristics that allow us tune as we go. Adoption of these methods requires a shift in thinking, and it is that shift that I seek to support in this text. 

I promise to use plain English throughout, and only use math notation to illustrate how models work and to make sure we're on the same page.
