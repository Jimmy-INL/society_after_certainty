# Society After Certainty

This free computational intelligence primer delves into the code and math behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in use today. It's a fascinating, sprawling field, so the terrain explored here is by no means exhaustive, yet I hope there is enough to inspire you to journey further.

The title refers to my belief that computational intelligence has a role to play in moving human society beyond its legacy of toxic certainty. As biological creatures, we have blind spots. Our individual practices of mind and conceptions of reality don't always line up with how reality is actually behaving when observed as a complex adaptive system. Computational intelligence is one of a handful of human traditions dedicated to expanding our capacity to comprehend complexity. Oh, and the tools sometimes feel like magic! 

I promise to use plain spoken language throughout, and only use math notation to make sure we're on the same page.  Math equations can sometimes look scarry, but over the years I have found them to be quite friendly and cuddley if you get to know them, and they can be loyal companions when venturing into uncharteted terrain.
