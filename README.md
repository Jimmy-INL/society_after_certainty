# society_after_certainty

This book delves into the math, code and intuition of some of the most beloved algorithms and heuristics in machine learning. 
I have done my best to assemble an inspiring bouquet, yet the arrangement is by no means exhaustive. The history of science is a burgeoning, fecund garden of discovery, and what I have assembled here is merely a collection of flowers that happened to be bloom in the age I found myself. 

I have done my best to fold in historical context and real-world applications, as well as moments of reflection from the humanities and knowledge traditions beyond my particular occidental heritage. I hope this helps to ventilate the narrative. Perhaps youâ€™ll find it more loquacious than you typically fancy from a STEM text, but I believe there are more facets to your humanity that can serve your career as a computational scientist, and I aim to make space for them at the table.  

I also believe in building a society after certainty, which demands our committed destabilization of any knowledge system that foolishly positions itself as the great explainer of all things. Such obnoxious postures of thought are not becoming to we who champion new horizons of inference. 

This book is free. It is my offering to the community of researchers, mathematicians, philosophers, and engineers whose collegial sparring have sharpened my mind, and encouraged me to dive deeper into the depths of the unknown.
