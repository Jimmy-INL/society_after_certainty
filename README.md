# Society After Certainty

This book delves into the math, code and intuition of some of the most beloved algorithms and heuristics in machine learning. 
I have done my best to assemble an inspiring bouquet, yet the arrangement is by no means exhaustive. The history of science is a burgeoning, fecund garden of discovery, and what I have assembled here is merely a collection of flowers that happened to be bloom in the age I found myself. 

I have done my best to fold in historical context, real-world applications, as reflection from the humanities, as I believe there are many facets to your humanity that can serve your development as a computational scientist, and I aim to make space for all of those parts of you at the table.  

This book also touches upon knowledge traditions beyond the occidental lineage. I believe in a society after certainty, which demands we remain steadfast in destabilization of any knowledge system that foolishly positions itself as the great explainer of all things. Such obnoxious postures of thought are not becoming to we who champion new horizons of inference. 

This book is free. It is my offering to the community of researchers, mathematicians, philosophers, and engineers whose collegial sparring have sharpened my mind, and encouraged me to dive deeper into the depths of the unknown.
