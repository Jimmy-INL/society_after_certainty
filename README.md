# Society After Certainty

This machine leanring primer delves into the code and math behind some of the most common and useful concepts in machine learning, as well as a few tangents that hint at the breadth of this sprawling field. The terrain explored here is by no means exhaustive, yet I hope there is enough to inspire you to journey further.

The title refers to a vision I had which launched me into this line of research. In the vision I caught a glimpse of the society that will flourish once we have moved beyond the toxic legacy of reductionist approahes to complexity modeling. I saw the role computational intelligence could play in catalyzing this rennaisance, and how machine learning in particular could connect the broader umbrella of soft computing with real-world applications.  

I promise to use plain English throughout, and only use math notation to illustrate how models work and to make sure we're on the same page. If you find value here, please consider making a donation to this awesome organization: [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/)
