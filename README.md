# Society After Certainty

This free soft computing primer delves into the code and math behind some of the most common and useful algorithms and heuristics in use today. The scope is by no means exhaustive, yet represents a suite of tools I hope you will find inspiring. 

The title refers to my belief that soft computing can play a role a key role in moving society beyond the toxic effects of certainty, and both the individual and institutional levels. As biological creatures, we have blind spots. Our individual conceptions of reality don't always line up with how reality is behaving. Soft computing is one of many human traditions that is dedicated to developing new forms of inference and meaning-making that expand our capacity to comprehend complexity. Oh, and the tools sometimes feel like magic! 

I promise to use plain spoken language throughout, and only use math notation to make sure we're on the same page.  Math equations can sometimes look scarry, but over the years I have found them to be quite friendly and cuddley if you get to know them, and they can be loyal companions when venturing into uncharteted terrain.
